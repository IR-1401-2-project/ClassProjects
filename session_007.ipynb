      "Methods to determine the validity of regression models include comparison of model predictions and coefficients with theory, collection of new data to check model predictions. comparison of results with theoretical model calculations, and data splitting or cross-validation in which a portion of the data is used to estimate the model coefficients, and the remainder of the data is used to measure the prediction accuracy of the model. An expository review of these methods is presented. It is concluded that data splitting is an effective method of model validation when it is not practical to collect new data to test the model. The DUPLEX algorithm, developed by R. W. Kennard, is recommended for dividing the data into the estimation set and prediction set when there is no obvious variable such as time to use as a basis to split the data. Several examples are included to illustrate the various methods of model validation.\n",

Comments on variable selection procedures, model validation, and ridge and generalized inverse regression computation procedures are included. The examples studied here show that when the predictor variables are highly correlated, ridge regression produces coefficients which predict and extrapolate better than least squares and is a safe procedure for selecting variables.\n",

Statistical education has traditionally focused on developing knowledge and skills and assumed that students would create value for the subject in the process. This approach hasn't worked. It is argued that we can help students better learn statistical thinking and methods and create value for its use by focusing both the content and delivery of statistical education on how people use statistical thinking and methods to learn, solve problems, and improve processes. Learning from your experiences, by using statistical thinking in real-life situations, is an effective way to create value for a subject and build knowledge and skills at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.

The objective of this paper is to present some guidelines for deciding when the correlations among the x's are so large that the numerical accuracy and/or physical interpretation of regression results should be questioned. A measure of nonorthogonality is presented and the effects of correlated x's and poor model formulation on tho estimated coefficients are discussed.

Six Sigma has received considerable attention in the public press (eg New York Times, Wall Street Journal , USATODAY), the professional literature (Hahn, et al 1999, Harry 1998, Hoerl 1998) and at the 1998 and 1999 meetings of the ASQ’s Annual Quality Congress. Much of this discussion has been fueled by the huge successes of Six Sigma at Allied Signal, General Electric (GE) and Motorola.

      "A graphical procedure for the display of treatment means that enables one to determine the statistical significance of the observed differences is presented. It is shown that the widely used least significant difference and honestly significant difference statistics can be used to construct plots in which any two means whose uncertainty intervals do not overlap are significantly different at the assigned probability level. It is argued that these plots, because of their straightforward decision rules, are more effective than those that show the observed means with standard errors or confidence limits. Several examples of the proposed displays are included to illustrate the procedure.\n",

      "Graphical displays have been used for many years in the interpretation of statistical analyses such as regression and analysis of variance. However, graphical techniques have been used rarely in the analysis of contingency tables. In the majority of statistics texts, the reader is instructed on the use of the chi-squared test for independence; howevrr, plotting techniques are rarely mentioned. When a significant chi-squared statistic is encountered, it is often of interest to determine which rows and/or columns of the contengency table are producing the significant chi-squared statistic. Cox and Lauh [1] and Fienberg [a] have developed graphical techniques which are based on half normal probability plots. Thcse procedures develop statistics which are functions of the original entries in the table; however, the table itself is not displayed.

In particular, though positive change is certainly taking place, we do not believe that the statistics community has fully accepted and come to grips with the radical changes in our environment over the past 20–40 years. In short, we believe that our environment has changed radically, whereas our own changes have been incremental in nature. One such change that seems particularly difficult for us to …\n",

      "Regression models of the forms proposed by Scheffé and by Becker have been widely and usefully applied to describe the response surfaces of mixture systems. These models do not contain a constant term. It has been common practice to test the statistical significance of these mixture models by the same statistical procedures used for other regression models whose constant term is absent (e.g., because the regression must pass through the origin). In this paper we show that the common practice produces misleading reslllts for mixtures. The mixture models require a different set of F, R 2, and R A 2 statistics. The correct mixture statistics correspond to a physically consistent null hypothesis and are also consistent with the expression of the mixture model in the older “slack-variable” form. An illustrative example is included.\n",

      "Alot of discussion about project selection is happening in companies deploying Six Sigma. Indeed, many believe project selection is the most difficult element of Six Sigma deployment. Six Sigma is about improving processes by solving problems. Typically, problems fall into two categories: solution known and solution unknown. Solution known projects are considered just-do projects and are completed by a project manager. Solution unknown projects are ones that need the Six Sigma methodology to solve. They are completed by BBs or Green Belts. Individual Six Sigma projects should link clearly to business priorities as reflected by the strategic and annual operating plans. Project areas include waste reduction, capacity increase and more efficient raw material usage or yield improvement. Customer satisfaction issues such as on-time delivery and defect reduction also make good Six Sigma projects.\n",

      "Many companies embarking on a lean Six Sigma program fail to get the most out of the union because they take too narrow a view of improvement. Organizations that successfully pursue lean Six Sigma will do so by taking a holistic view of the business, adopting a holistic improvement method, and establishing an integrated project management system. Achieving comprehensive improvement requires both the ability of lean to achieve simplicity and the ability of Six Sigma to manage complexity. Harnessing their mutual reinforcing power most effectively requires a holistic improvement system. In such a system, the ultimate criterion of success is neither reduced waste nor reduced process variation, but achieving maximum sustainable improvement.\n",

Past studies in this area have suffered from inadequate information on actual lead exposure at the air lead levels of concern.

Hydrophobicity is a critical property that affects the dissolution of powder formulations, tablets and capsules as well as the performance of tablet coating and granulation operations. In this paper, hydrophobicity is measured using a modified Washburn method. Results show that, in the absence of lubricant, the hydrophobicity of powders does not change substantially as a function of shear rate or strain. However, when magnesium stearate is present (concentrations studied here range between 0.5% and 2%), hydrophobicity increases as a function of strain, shear rate and lubricant concentration. Observed changes range over several orders of magnitude, readily explaining common “overlubrication” observations of delayed drug dissolution.\n",

      "Six Sigma is a process-focused, statistically-based approach to business improvement that companies such as Motorola, Allied-Signal and General Electric have used to produce millions of dollars in bottom-line improvements. To date Six Sigma initiatives have been primarily focused on improving the performance of manufacturing processes. There is a growing awareness that additional gains in efficiency and operational performance can be achieved by widening the scope of Six Sigma to include the improvement of non-manufacturing, administrative and service functions. The economic advantage of such efforts are potentially very significant because: 1. the administrative component of modern manufacturing is large and has a great influence on overall economic performance, and 2. the service industry is in a modem society well over two-thirds of the entire economy.\n",

      "1986/10/1\n",
      "Cited by 37\n",
      "It is common practice to mathematically transform or re-express data (e.g., logs, reciprocals, square roots) to ensure that the assumptions of normal distribution statistics are more closely satisfied. Re-expression is a problem in some instances because the original scale of measurement is not used and the relationship between the response and predictor variables is often not simplified. It is shown that these limitations can be avoided by applying the re-expression function to both the response and the proposed model form and estimating the model parameters by nonlinear least squares techniques. The model form is not altered, the units of the predicted values and uncertainty are those of the original measurement scale, and the modeling assumptions of homogeneous variance and normal distribution of observation errors are satisfied. Several examples are included to illustrate the variety of circumstances in which …\n",

This implies that an exposure to an additional 1 μg Pb/m3 of air can result in an increase of approximately 1 μg Pb/100 ml of blood. The precision of the slope for adults is rarely better than ±0.5 to ±0.7 and can be as large as ±1.0. A large portion of this uncertainty in the calculated slope is due to blood lead measurement error. The slope of the blood lead-air lead response for children ranges from 0.7 to 1.4 and is approximately the same as that for adults.

The reaction is initiated with glutamate dehydrogenase and the rate of depletion of NADPH is monitored with two measurements, 17 s apart, at 340 nm. Reaction conditions have been optimized for maximum sensitivity through both one-factor-at-a-time and multiple variable response surface optimization techniques. Linearity to 1000 mumol of ammonia per liter of plasma has been achieved. No significant interferences were observed from anticoagulants or endogenous blood components, including pyruvate and oxalacetate.

These statistics are analysed to determine the statistical significance of the effects of experimental treatments on the size and shape of the carrot. An example is included to illustrate this method of design, analysis and interpretation.\n",

      "A method for characterizing the geometrical appearance of two-dimensional objects and those three-dimensional objects which can be represented by a figure in two dimensions is presented. These objects can be reasonably described using the length measured along the longest axis and p diameters (width) along the length axis. Two objects, measured in this way, will be similar in shape if the diameter-to-length ratios are equal at all positions. Analysis of variance of these ratios is used to test the significance of experimental treatment effects on the shape of such objects. A numerical example is presented to illustrate these procedures of design, analysis and interpretation.\n",

      "SIX SIGMA AND, MORE RECENTLY, LEAN SIX SIGMA have had a significant bottom-line impact on numerous organizations around the globe. While some may view lean Six Sigma as\" yesterday's news,\" the current economic situation is driving more organizations to look beyond traditional cost-cutting to find long-term solutions to their difficult financial situations. Fortunately, saving large sums of money never goes out of style, and the documented savings from lean Six Sigma at organizations such as GE, Bank of America, Motorola and many others is irrefutable. As manufacturing companies experience the success oflean Six Sigma in improving manufacturing processes, they naturally want to expand the effort to improving processes outside of manufacturing-the so-called transactional or service processes, such as accounting, logistics, legal and purchasing resources. In addition, many non manufacturing organizations, such as hospitals and banks, are searching for ways to improve their efficiency and, ultimately, their bottom lines. Many believe that there is as much opportunity for improvement outside of manufacturing as within. For example, in 2002, quality management professor Soren Bisgaard noted that the major growth in the US labor force is in so-called white-collar jobs that require primarily mental work, such as accounting and computer science. Figure 1, derived from Bisgaard's research, shows this trend over the past century. Note that in this graph\" blue collar\" is intended to refer to primarily physical labor, such as working on an assembly line, while\" service\" refers to working directly with customers, such as hotel receptionists and …\n"
