      "Methods to determine the validity of regression models include comparison of model predictions and coefficients with theory, collection of new data to check model predictions. comparison of results with theoretical model calculations, and data splitting or cross-validation in which a portion of the data is used to estimate the model coefficients, and the remainder of the data is used to measure the prediction accuracy of the model. An expository review of these methods is presented. It is concluded that data splitting is an effective method of model validation when it is not practical to collect new data to test the model. The DUPLEX algorithm, developed by R. W. Kennard, is recommended for dividing the data into the estimation set and prediction set when there is no obvious variable such as time to use as a basis to split the data. Several examples are included to illustrate the various methods of model validation.\n",

In particular, though positive change is certainly taking place, we do not believe that the statistics community has fully accepted and come to grips with the radical changes in our environment over the past 20–40 years.

      "Regression models of the forms proposed by Scheffé and by Becker have been widely and usefully applied to describe the response surfaces of mixture systems. These models do not contain a constant term. It has been common practice to test the statistical significance of these mixture models by the same statistical procedures used for other regression models whose constant term is absent (e.g., because the regression must pass through the origin). In this paper we show that the common practice produces misleading reslllts for mixtures. The mixture models require a different set of F, R 2, and R A 2 statistics. The correct mixture statistics correspond to a physically consistent null hypothesis and are also consistent with the expression of the mixture model in the older “slack-variable” form.

Six Sigma is about improving processes by solving problems. Typically, problems fall into two categories: solution known and solution unknown. Solution known projects are considered just-do projects and are completed by a project manager. Solution unknown projects are ones that need the Six Sigma methodology to solve. They are completed by BBs or Green Belts. Individual Six Sigma projects should link clearly to business priorities as reflected by the strategic and annual operating plans. Project areas include waste reduction, capacity increase and more efficient raw material usage or yield improvement. Customer satisfaction issues such as on-time delivery and defect reduction also make good Six Sigma projects.\n",

      "Many companies embarking on a lean Six Sigma program fail to get the most out of the union because they take too narrow a view of improvement. Organizations that successfully pursue lean Six Sigma will do so by taking a holistic view of the business, adopting a holistic improvement method, and establishing an integrated project management system. Achieving comprehensive improvement requires both the ability of lean to achieve simplicity and the ability of Six Sigma to manage complexity. Harnessing their mutual reinforcing power most effectively requires a holistic improvement system. In such a system, the ultimate criterion of success is neither reduced waste nor reduced process variation, but achieving maximum sustainable improvement.\n",

      "It does not appear to be widely recognized that a computer can be a useful aid in the design of experiments as well as in the analysis of the data. The computer can be particularly useful in the administration of an experimental program and in developing experimental plans for those situations in which the classic designs (e.g., factorial and response surface) are not applicable. Such situations include irregularly-shaped experimental regions, mixture experiments and formulation studies, the need to construct unusual fractions of factorial designs, and experimental plans to estimate the parameters in nonlinear models. Several examples are presented to illustrate the practical problems encountered and how computer algorithms can be helpful in developing useful experimental designs.\n",

Hydrophobicity is a critical property that affects the dissolution of powder formulations, tablets and capsules as well as the performance of tablet coating and granulation operations. In this paper, hydrophobicity is measured using a modified Washburn method. Results show that, in the absence of lubricant, the hydrophobicity of powders does not change substantially as a function of shear rate or strain. However, when magnesium stearate is present (concentrations studied here range between 0.5% and 2%), hydrophobicity increases as a function of strain, shear rate and lubricant concentration. Observed changes range over several orders of magnitude, readily explaining common “overlubrication” observations of delayed drug dissolution.\n",

      "An evaluation of the major studies of the effects of airborne lead on blood lead levels of male and female adult and child populations is presented. Analysis of these studies shows that the blood lead-air lead slope for adults is approximately 1.0 for both men and women. This implies that an exposure to an additional 1 μg Pb/m3 of air can result in an increase of approximately 1 μg Pb/100 ml of blood. The precision of the slope for adults is rarely better than ±0.5 to ±0.7 and can be as large as ±1.0. A large portion of this uncertainty in the calculated slope is due to blood lead measurement error. The slope of the blood lead-air lead response for children ranges from 0.7 to 1.4 and is approximately the same as that for adults. The accuracy of this number is less clear for children than adults due to the small data base. Many of the studies of children have been on populations living in the vicinity of smelters. It is …\n",

The assay requires a sample volume of 500 muL for a kinetic ammonia measurement. The reaction is initiated with glutamate dehydrogenase and the rate of depletion of NADPH is monitored with two measurements, 17 s apart, at 340 nm. Reaction conditions have been optimized for maximum sensitivity through both one-factor-at-a-time and multiple variable response surface optimization techniques. Linearity to 1000 mumol of ammonia per liter of plasma has been achieved. No significant interferences were observed from anticoagulants or endogenous blood components, including pyruvate and oxalacetate. Use of the coenzyme NADPH (instead of NADH) in this aca procedure eliminates the lengthy pre-incubation otherwise required for endogenous dehydrogenase reactions.\n",

However, the diet must supply the essential amino acids, or they must be added if there is to be a positive response. An amino acid imbalance was observed when 0.5% lysine was added to a diet containing 2% urea. It was overcome by supplementing the diet with tryptophan and methionine. When imbalances were observed, food intake was depressed. Blood urea levels were higher when pigs were fed diets containing urea.

While some may view lean Six Sigma as\" yesterday's news,\" the current economic situation is driving more organizations to look beyond traditional cost-cutting to find long-term solutions to their difficult financial situations. Fortunately, saving large sums of money never goes out of style, and the documented savings from lean Six Sigma at organizations such as GE, Bank of America, Motorola and many others is irrefutable. As manufacturing companies experience the success oflean Six Sigma in improving manufacturing processes, they naturally want to expand the effort to improving processes outside of manufacturing-the so-called transactional or service processes, such as accounting, logistics, legal and purchasing resources. In addition, many non manufacturing organizations, such as hospitals and banks, are searching for ways to improve their efficiency and, ultimately, their bottom lines. Many believe that there is as much opportunity for improvement outside of manufacturing as within. For example, in 2002, quality management professor Soren Bisgaard noted that the major growth in the US labor force is in so-called white-collar jobs that require primarily mental work, such as accounting and computer science.

We refer to these fundamentals as missing links in the Big Data process. In this paper, we illustrate the challenges of making decisions from Big Data through a series of case studies. We offer some strategies to help ensure that projects based on Big Data analyses are successful. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "Driven by greater global competition and the growing impact of information technology, the pharmaceutical industry faces a need to improve its performance. Speed to market, product quality, regulatory compliance, cost reduction, waste, and cycle time are among the concerns that must be addressed in a systematic, focused, and sustainable manner. Quality by design (QbD), an approach offered by the US Food and Drug Administration, provides an effective tool for addressing these concerns. This article discusses the key steps for implementing QbD by providing a focus on how to develop the process understanding that leads to a useful design space, process-control methods, and characterization of process risk. Product and process life-cycle model validation is also addressed. Integrating these concepts provides a holistic approach for effectively designing and improving products and processes from the development of an active pharmaceutical ingredient to its manufacture and for other pharmaceutical processes.\n",

      "2005/10\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND: PHOTODISC anaging deviations in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes is one of the highest priorities for any drug maker. Yet companies vary significantly in that capability. Manufacturers that have the most mature deviation-management capability use information about process variances to improve and upgrade their systems and processes continuously to mitigate risk and reduce cost. Companies that are least mature in their deviation-management capability focus only on eliminating individual variances in the interest of a short-term objective such as a batch disposition. Some manufacturers lack a systematic approach designed to address the root causes of deviations and find themselves mired in variances and incomplete resolutions, often repeatedly facing the same deviation. Capacity, efficiency, and the ability to serve patient needs suffer, and noncompliance risk increases.\n",
      "Six Sigma methodology provides the strategy, methods, and tools to create a systematic approach to deviation reduction. Pharmaceutical companies are uniquely suited to leverage the set of rigorous analytical techniques that are required to identify root causes and correct them. Moreover, Six Sigma has been proven to be a statistically precise and rigorous tool in stringent operational and regulated environments and can address all dimensions of organizational excellence (1). By using Six Sigma tools, systems, and thinking to address deviations individually and collectively, drug makers can dramatically increase the probability of finding root causes, make\n",

Such a system can provide a common language for improvement across functions and processes, enable precise definition and scoping of improvement projects, and offer a method for guiding project teams through problem solving and process improvement. In time, improvement becomes a routine managerial process, just like any other, and continuous improvement becomes an integral part of the way the organization works. Where to start on such a big job? Experience has shown that adopting define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) as the preferred problem solving and process improvement framework takes an organization a giant step closer to making improvement part of “the way we work.”\n",

      "Six Sigma is a process-focused, statistically based approach to business improvement that companies such as Motorola, Allied-Signal, and General Electric have used to produce millions of dollars in bottom-line improvements. Six Sigma also provides opportunities for significant leadership roles within organizations deploying it. However, such roles require new skills for those with statistical or quality management backgrounds. In fact, many statisticians and quality professionals are passed over for such roles because they are either not looking for leadership roles, or are not viewed by their management as candidates. The need for migrating to more proactive and leadership roles, given changes occurring in our environment, will be addressed first. Following this, we discuss what leadership really is, and how statisticians and quality professionals could aspire to such roles, without giving up their technical skills or …\n",

      "As organizations implement Six Sigma over time, they eventually begin to look for ways to make the approach part of how work is done on a regular basis. The result is an ever broadening use of Six Sigma beyond process improvement. Making this transition requires Six Sigma to become part of how you do everything. One way to help make Six Sigma your signature is to adopt the 5-phase define, measure, analyze, improve, control Six Sigma process improvement method as your general, all-purpose problem solving tool. Another way to make Six Sigma part of an organization's signature play is to use it as a culture change and leadership development tool. The improvement project selection, project review, recognition, reward, and communication processes used to support Six Sigma act as effective cultural change vehicles.\n",

      "Cited by 12\n",
      "Blood lead and air lead levels of children who lived within 32 km of a smelter in Kellogg, ID were measured in 1974 and 1975. While an analysis of the 1974 survey has appeared, the results of the 1975 survey and an evaluation of the change in blood lead levels of those children who participated in both the 1974 and 1975 surveys has not previously been discussed in the literature. It Is concluded that, for these data, in the air lead range of 0.5–5 μg/m3, the blood lead-air lead relationship can be adequately described by blood lead-air lead slope which is approximately 1.0 and at most 1.4. This slope was also found to be Independent of children’s age. It Is shown that an accurate estimate of the blood lead-air lead relationship cannot be obtained without taking proper account of selected environmental variables; specifically, pica, sex, age, father’s work status, education, and home cleanliness.\n",

      "Design of experiments (DoE) has been an effective tool for experimenters, statisticians and quality professionals for decades. DoE has evolved since the seminal work of Sir Ronald A. Fisher in the 1920s, and since George EP Box and his colleagues enhanced and popularized the approach in the process industries in the 1950s and 1960s. The utility of the method has even spread to the service industries, backed by a growing amount of literature. 1, 2\n",
      "A key aspect of experimentation is that it is sequential. Box emphasized that experimentation and learning is an iterative process, as shown in Figure 1. Problems are rarely solved and significant advances in knowledge are rarely made after a single experiment. Learning is a process, not an event. With some exceptions, a series of experiments is usually the norm. When you look at the plethora of DoE books on the market, however, you see little discussion on the sequential (iterative) nature of the endeavor. This is due, in large part, to the statistics profession’s focus on individual statistical tools without thinking about how the tools are sequenced and linked to solve problems.\n",

Some quality professionals are starting to realize every training event should have a clear, measurable business benefit. Six Sigma and its associated training can illustrate this alternative way to think about, design and deliver the kind of training that management will see as essential to the success of the organization. The key issue on the minds of American business executives is how to get better business results, including improving the bottom line.

      "This paper provides a method for prediction of weight variability of tablets made in rotary tablet presses as a function of material attributes and processing parameters. The goal was to be able to predict whether or not a formulation is suitable for direct compaction continuous manufacturing using the tablet weight variability as a criterion. The work focused on identifying the significant factors affecting the weight variability in tablets, within the design space studied. A wide range of blends with different powder properties were prepared. It was shown that among powder properties, cohesion, bulk density, and particle size were the most significant and sufficient material attributes to explain tablet weight variability. A response surface model was built and validated with three different blends. The model is not formulation dependent and can be expanded to include other blend properties or processing parameters effects.\n",

      "2015\n",
      "\n",
      "The lifecycle management of an analytical procedure applying Quality by Design (QbD) concepts and using the analytical target profile (ATP) has been introduced by the USP stimuli article “Lifecycle Management of Analytical Procedures: Method Development, Procedure Performance Qualification, and Procedure Performance Verification [1].” Current regulatory guidance around process validation is moving away from a simple once-and-done validation, and toward a continuous process verification approach, also called a “lifecycle approach”[2]. The recent FDA method validation draft guidance also includes some discussion of a lifecycle approach for analytical methods [3]. A number of articles have been written introducing the lifecycle management of analytical procedures [4–7]. These articles introduced the concept that analytical procedures are processes and, as such, the tools, approaches and statistical analyses for manufacturing processes can be applied to analytical procedures. The benefit of recognizing and acknowledging the similarity between quality by design for manufacturing processes and analytical quality by design (aQbD) is that it will allow the application of the experience, knowledge, tools, and statistics from QbD to be applied to aQbD. Thus, all parties, laboratories, companies, Quality Assurance, production, as well as regulatory bodies can leverage their experience with QbD in developing an approach to aQbD. A key component of the aQbD paradigm is the definition of the Analytical Target Profile (ATP)[1], analogous to the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) in the ICH [8]. The ATP defines the requirements for the result …\n",

Yes, this is the same Six Sigma that arose at Motorola in the 1980s and achieved legendary status at General Electric under then-CEO Jack Welch.

      "In recent years a growing need has been felt to improve people's judgemental abilities. An accumulating body of research on information processing, decision making, clinical judgement, and probability estimation has documented a substantial lack of ability across both individuals and situations (Slovic, 1972; Slovic, Fischoff & Lichtenstein, 1977). These studies challenge the previously prevalent assumption (influenced mainly by psychoanalytic theory) that the above shortcomings are necessarily due to interference from noncognitive sources. Dawes (1976) claims that rather thon attribute cognitive dysfunction to motivational and emotional factors, one should acknowledge the fact that cognitive capacities are limited, and rationality is\" bounded.\" Tversky and Kahneman (1974) describe several heuristics on which people rely when assessing the probability of on Uncertain event or the value of an Uncertain quantity. These heuristics reduce the task complexity, and in general they are quite Useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systemotic bioses. Intuition has been shown to lead Us astray in judgements of randomness (Falk, 1975) and in prediection tasks (Goldberg, 1968). Predictive ability has been found to have low (and even zero) validity in clinical settings and neither professional training nor a large amount of available information are known to increase predictive qccuracy. However, the fallibility of intuitive judgements does not seem to discourage the judges. Einhorn and Hogarth (1978) describe the\" persistence of the illusion of validity.\" They emphasize their point by quoting La Rochefoucault:\" Everyone complains of his memory …\n",

      "This session discusses how to attack large, complex, unstructured statistical problems. It is based on the 2nd edition of the book Statistical Thinking: Improving Business Performance (Hoerl and Snee 2012), recently released as part of the Wiley-SAS Business Series. There is considerable interest in determining how to attack complex statistical problems, ie, those that “… do not correspond to a recognizable textbook chapter”(Meng 2009). Most textbook problems, as well as problems discussed at conferences and in publications, tend to be narrowly defined, and require one “correct” statistical method to solve. In contrast, large, complex problems typically are broad in scope, and require some upfront work simply to provide structure. They require a dynamic process view, as opposed to static population view, to properly understand and interpret multiple sources of data. In addition, such problems almost always require effective integration of multiple statistical methods into an overall approach to scientific inquiry, not just identification of the one “correct” statistical tool. In short, they require creative and innovative thought–statistical thinking, in addition to knowledge of the tools. The authors have used the term statistical engineering to refer to the integration of multiple statistical methods and tools to address complex problems (Hoerl and Snee 2010). JMP can provide significant insight to practitioners when faced with such problems. While no “Easy 7 Step Method” exists for large, complex problems, the authors present guidelines for thinking about and attacking such problems.\n",

For example, medicines and therapies have become far more complex since the days when medications like antibiotics were taken briefly to treat acute and relatively straightforward conditions. Today whole new classes of drugs have appeared for chronic conditions. Further, with many of the easy therapeutic targets having been hit, pharmaceutical companies now often focus on far more complicated therapeutic areas like oncology, AIDS, and Parkinson’s, requiring more complex medicines. QbD, with its ability to scientifically establish the complex multidimensional combination and interactions of input variables and process parameters that determine the quality of a product, works particularly well in complex contexts. In biotech, for example, where testing a product is far more complex than with small molecules and where characterization of the final product is less developed and understood for biologics such as protein therapeutics and vaccines, QbD offers great promise. In biotech, the process is, in effect, the product; and because high levels of variation are often seen in biological processes, developing robust and reliable processes is inherently difficult. QbD, however, frees biotech companies to focus more on analytical tools to understand and control process development and manufacturing, which …\n",

      "with $1 billion in annual sales cannot efficiently produce drugs with $500 million in annual sales. Only by improving and redesigning processes of all types—manufacturing, R&D, marketing, sales—can pharma companies generate bottomline savings that can be used to fuel growth and speed up the development of new products to create top-line growth. The push for improvement is also coming from FDA, EMEA, and ICH guidelines that encourage scientifically-based approaches to quality and compliance that promise to usher in a new era in manufacturing. However, implementing the concepts embodied in those guidelines—Process Analytical Technology (PAT), Quality by Design (QbD), and Design Space—will require new, more rigorous ways of doing things. Given a future in which the big winners in pharma are likely to be low-cost producers and companies that innovate, the potential benefits of fulfilling the improvement imperative are significant. In manufacturing, reduced rework and fewer lost batches mean improved yields and higher productivity. Additional benefits include more compliant processes, fewer inspections and costly shutdowns, reduced regulatory burden, increased equipment uptime and plant utilization, more robust products, processes, and analytical methods, and greater speed to market with more innovative products. In non-manufacturing processes, the benefits include better quality of service, shorter cycle times, less rework and waste, reduced cost and streamlined processes.\n",

      "SIR: Thequantitative determination of an air quality standard for lead is an important and complicated issue that has not been given adequate attention. Brunekreef accurately summarizes my proposed approach (1) and raises some important issues. I will discuss his concerns in the order in which he raisedthem. It will be apparent that I do not agree with some of hisviews. We must keep inmind at the outset that there are two key elements under discussion: the statistical methodology used to develop the air quality standard and the data base usedto derive the estimated distribution of blood lead values and the blood lead-air lead relationship used in theprocedure. Changes in the latter require only a recomputation while disagreements over the former re-quire a reformulation of the statistical model used. The proper formulation is critical because it can result only after we have an understanding of the system we are …\n",

Quality professionals are frequently confronted with problems that require the collection and analysis ofdata. For example, a new raw material source may create the need to redefine process operating conditions. A new process has been developed and it is necessary to demonstrate that it produces a product whose quality is as good as that of the existing process. Critical product properties are showing excessive variation and it is of interest to determine which process variables are producing the variation. The use of statistically designed experiments can contribute to the solution of each of these problems. Daniel's book can help one choose the appropriate experimental design and analyze …\n",

The results, although not conclusive, indicate that some urea (1 to 2%) can be used by the growing pigs. However, the diet must supply the essential amino acids, or they must be added if there is to be a positive response. An amino acid imbalance was observed when 0.5% lysine was added to a diet containing 2% urea. It was overcome by supplementing the diet with tryptophan and methionine. When imbalances were observed, food intake was depressed. Blood urea levels were higher when pigs were fed diets containing urea. The increase of blood urea levels was directly related to the dietary level of urea and inversely related to the length of time pigs were fed urea. urea.\n",

      "This is the first of a series of short commentaries on the use of Quality by Design (QbD) in the pharma and biotech industries. The use of QbD has steadily grown since its introduction around 2005. The growth has not been fast enough for some and perhaps too fast for others. Some of the resistance is due to lack of understanding what QbD is. This is not uncommon for a new idea. QbD is new to pharma and biotech but not new to other industries. This is good news as pharma and biotech can learn from the experience of others. The breadth of application and understanding of QbD has grown since it was first introduced mainly in the chemical industry in the 1950s and 1960s. I learned about QbD in my graduate work at Rutgers University and practiced and enhanced the art and science, first during by 24 year tenure at DuPont and today as a keen focus of my consulting practice and research programs.\n",
      "It is important to begin these commentaries by answering the question'What is QbD'; and then discuss the building blocks of QbD. The ICH Q8 (R2) definition is that QbD is a\" Systematic approach to product and process development that begins with predefined objectives, emphasizes product and process understanding and process control and is based on sound science and quality risk management (1).\" In other words, Quality by Design is about building quality into products and processes, not attempting to inspect quality in at the end on the line.\n",
